  * Handle edge cases like permission issues or missing files

* **Settings Implementation**
  * Connect the existing settings tab to the actual plugin functionality

  * Refactor the large `addJournalToPanel()` function into smaller, focused methods

  * Preserve scroll position when updating the view

* **Styling & Appearance**
  * Add visual indicators when content is being saved
  * Improve the collapsible UI with smooth animations
